### Our Book

If you're new to these technologies and want to learn how to implement them, check out [our book](https://github.com/builderbook/builderbook-app/blob/master/book-details.md), where we show you step-by-step how to build this web app from scratch. And we wrote it using our Builder Book app!

Unlike most coding tutorials and books, which focus on the fundamentals of a programming language, our book teaches you the process of building a web app. You'll learn how to develop with React, set up custom servers, choose and integrate third-party libraries and services, build and integrate APIs, deploy to a live site, and more.
