## Support This Project

Our project is free and open source. If you want to support it and learn how we built this app, check out [our book](https://builderbook.org/books/book-1/introduction).

In the book, we teach you how to build this web app from scratch - with [individual codebases](https://github.com/builderbook/book-1-code) for every chapter. We wrote our book using this web app.

Our book is ideal for junior developers who want to learn how to build their own web apps. You should know fundamentals of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Experience with React is helpful but not a must-have.
