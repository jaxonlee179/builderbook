## Build this app from scratch

### Our Book

[Build a production-ready web app from scratch: React, NextJS, Material-UI, JavaScript, Express, MongoDB and more](https://builderbook.org/book/book-1)

We used this web app to create our own book that teaches you how to **build the app from scratch**. Our book is not just a step-by-step recipe. We provide in-depth explanations of **how the code works**, line by line.

You'll learn how to set up your development environment, servers, and databases; set up **Google login** for your readers; send emails with **AWS SES**; build your book interface and publish books via **Github API**; create a newsletter for your readers; and finally **sell books with Stripe**.

Check out the [Introduction](https://builderbook.org/book/book-1/introduction) and preview each chapter for free. The [complete book](https://builderbook.org/book/book-1) is sold on our website for $49.
