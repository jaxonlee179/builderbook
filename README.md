### Our Book

In our book, we teach you how to build this web app from scratch - with [individual codebases](https://github.com/builderbook/book-1-code) for every chapter. We wrote the book using this web app.

The introduction and table of contents are [here](https://builderbook.org/books/book-1/introduction).

#### Who this book is for

Our book is ideal for junior developers who want to learn how to build a web app from scratch. 

You should know fundamentals of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Experience with React is helpful but not a must-have.

#### Pre-order

Our book is currently available to [pre-order for $29](https://builderbook.org/books/book-1/introduction). You'll instantly get chapters 1-6 (out of 9 total), and we'll notify you as new chapters are released. After pre-order (mid Feburary), the book will cost $49.

#### Free for Techstars Founders

As Techstars founders (Atlanta '16), we're giving back by offering a free book copy to other Techstars founders. Email your name, company, and Techstars batch to team@builderbook.org, and we'll give you access to the book.
